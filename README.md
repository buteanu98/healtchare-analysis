In healthcare, improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality patient care is a top priority. In this Power BI report, I explored a real-world dataset to uncover hospital efficiency insights for a fictional consulting company called HealthStat. 
I analyzed attributes impacting the patient length of stay (LOS) and cost and work to identify factors contributing to hospital differences. 
I used my DAX skills to create measures and generate insightful visualizations. 
In the end I brought it all together in a sophisticated business dashboard to communicate insights for the HealthStat team.
